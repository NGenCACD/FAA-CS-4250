## Purpose

The purpose of this system will aid pliots in avoiding other flying airplanes.
The system will receive real-time radar data and need to continuously calculate
if a collision is likely, and give several different levels of warning. The
system will need to deal with the entire range of fixed - and rotary-wing
aircraft.
